I wanted to make a quick note about something I found incredibly helpful the other day.

Lists (or ArrayLists, as new Computer Science students are often taught in their CS 101 courses), are a data strucures that are fundamentally based on arrays, but with additional methods associated with them.  Lists are generally filled with an ```append``` method, that fills indices in this array.  Lists are often useful in the case where the number of intial spots that will be filled is unknown.  

<!--more-->

The base arrays are generally associated with a ```size``` or ```length``` parameter, that initializes the array to a certain length.  Under the hood (and generally hidden from the user), however, the ```List``` class also has a ```resize``` method that adds available space to the array when a certain percentage of available indices are occupied, technically allowing the size of the list to grow, and grow, and grow...

Perptually applying ```resize```, however, is slow, especially in the case where you're appending a lot of items.  All of the data currently in the ```List``` object will need to be moved into the new, resized array.

I needed to aggregate a large number (couple thousand) of Pandas DataFrame objects, each saved as a single file, into a single DataFrame.  My first thought was to simply incrementally load and append all incoming DataFrames to a list, and then use ```pandas.concat``` to aggregate them all together.  Appending all of these DataFrames together became incredibly time consuming (at this point, I remembered the ```resize``` issue).

A quick Google search led me to the following solution, allowing me to predefine how large I wanted my list to be:

```python
# For simplicity assume we have 10 items
known_size = 10
initialized_list = [None]*known_size

print(len(initialized_list))
10
```

Neat, huh?  And ridiculously simple.  Now, rather than append, we can do the following:

```python
for j, temp_file in enumerate(list_of_files):
    loaded_file = load_file(temp_file)
    initialized_list[j] = loaded_file
```

Because the **memory has already been pre-allocated**, the ```resize``` method is never accessed, and we save time.  I also found [this blog post](http://zwmiller.com/blogs/python_data_structure_speed.html) with some information about timing with regards to Numpy arrays, lists, and tuples -- the author shows that indexing into a Numpy array is actually slower than indexing into a list.  Numpy arrays are primarilly useful in the case where operations can be vectorized -- then they're the clear winners in terms of speed.
