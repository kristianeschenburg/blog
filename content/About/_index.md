<p>
I'm a Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle, working in the field of medical imaging.  I work at the <a href="http://ibic.washington.edu/#&panel1-1">Integrated Brain Imaging Center</a>, a neuroscience lab focused on using magnetic resonance imaging to better-understand the human brain.  Using techniques from statistics, graph theory, optimization, and machine learning, I'm developing methods to help explore the relationship between brain structure and function.  I'm perpetually driven by curiosity and (often) fueled by coffee.
</p>

<p>
Beyond neuroscience, I'm broadly interested in statistics, software development, and open-source science.  Previously, I completed a Summer internship at the <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a> as part of their Data Science group, where I studied algorithms related to dynamic networks.  I also completed a Software Engineering internship at the biotechnology start-up <a href="https://phasegenomics.com/">Phase Genomics</a>where I contributed to their proprietary Python-based software to deconvolve and cluster noisy, multi-species DNA samples.

<p>
In my spare time, I like to mountaineer, ski, climb, trail run, tend to my tomato garden, and explore the Pacific Northwest!
